This project focuses on analyzing bank customer data to uncover valuable demographic and behavioral insights. The dashboard was built in Power BI using a combination of cards, donut charts, bar charts, column charts, matrices, and slicers to create an interactive and user-friendly experience.

The analysis highlights key aspects such as:

Customer Demographics: Total customers, gender distribution, age groups, and unique locations.

Account Balance Trends: Distribution of balances across genders.

Age Group Insights: Identifying dominant customer groups like Adults (25–39), Middle-aged (40–59), and Seniors (60+).

Location Analysis: Cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore emerged as top hubs with the largest customer bases.

Dynamic Filtering: Slicers for gender, location, and age groups make the dashboard interactive and customizable.

By leveraging DAX measures (e.g., Total Customers, Average Age, Unique Locations) and calculated columns, the project delivers actionable insights that can help banks understand their customer base, design targeted strategies, and improve decision-making.

✨ This project demonstrates the power of Power BI in transforming raw banking data into meaningful, visual, and interactive insights.
